OroCommerce Customer Tracking Bundle
==============================
This bundle adds support for user tracking code injection.

Currently supported trackers are:
* [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/)
* [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/)
* [FullStory](https://www.fullstory.com/)

For applicable trackers, the currently logged-in user will also be provided with the tracking payload.

NOTE: Google Analytics support has been removed as there is a superior bundle provided by Oro:
